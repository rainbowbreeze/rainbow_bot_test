## Google Cloud Functions management

To deploy the cloud function, open the Cloud IDE in the root folder of the project, then follow the steps in the first video

Select the region: https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#europe
europe-west8 -> Milan -> It doesn't work, so I selected europe-west3

Once the cloud function was deployed for the first time, edit the function and set the TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN env var following Google Cloud console UI help: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/configuring/env-var
